# Wisconsin Type Card Sorting Task - Psychopy Edition

![logo](logo.png)

This is a Python project where we have created a computer version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, running with PsychoPy. The end product is a game that can be run locally on any computer.

This project was inspired by the original paper by Esta Berg (1948). It was created for educational purposes as part of a university course at the Arctic University of Norway, UiT.
